# FRC-Fuel-Lights

## Code for an LED light strip illuminating FRC fuel balls

### Parts

* (1) Arduino Uno R3
* (36) FRC 2017 Steamworks Fuel Balls
* (1) breadboard
* (3) N-channel power MOSFET - 30V / 60A
* (1) 12V 5A switching power supply (9V is usable but will not be as bright)
* (1) 5-meter analog 5050 LED strip

After Wiring up the LEDs, string the Fuel Balls along them. In my experience, the best method is to pick two holes close to each other and run the lights through them with the LEDS shining into the center of the ball for maximum illumination.
